### 🆕 Add new tasks
To become the best version of yourself, you need to set new tasks and complete them!
Using our web app, adding new tasks is easy! Just **enter the text of your task in the text field** and **press Enter** and the new task will appear before your eyes, good luck with it!

### ✅ Mark tasks as completed
There's nothing more satisfying than marking tasks as completed. Just click on the **checkbox to the left of the task** and it becomes a confirmation of success! If you accidentally marked a task as completed or simply realise it's not completed, it's easy to fix: just **click on the same checkbox** to make it active again!

If you want to mark all uncompleted tasks as completed, simply click on the **button to the left of the text box**. If all tasks are marked equally as completed or active, this button will change all tasks to the opposite status (active to completed, completed to active)

### ✏️ Change and edit tasks
We understand that plans can change. Change the text or details of a task at any time, and your task list will always be up to date.
To do this, just **double-click on the task** and start editing the text, it's super easy! And to save your changes, just **press Enter** or **click outside the task**. If you change your mind about changing the task, **press Esc** and everything will be reset to its original state!

<a id="delete-tasks"></a>

### 🗑️ Delete tasks
If you decide that you no longer need a task, simply remove it from the list. We make it easy and painless, just hover your cursor over the task in question and you'll see an **X** button to the right of the task.

Of course, if you already have a bunch of completed tasks, you can easily do this by **clicking on the Clear completed** button

Or you can start **modifying the job text as above**, but **make a empty field** and then the task will be deleted as well

  </tr>

### 🔍 Filteration of tasks
In our application, there is also an opportunity to show not only all tasks, but also to select separately which tasks are currently active or which tasks are still pending. To do this, **select one of the buttons at the bottom of the application** (the bottom panel will not be visible if there are no tasks).
All for your convenience!
